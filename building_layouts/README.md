>  Material Apps vs Non Material Apps : 

Building a flutter application allows us to chose between material and no material design, both have their specific properties and implementation based on your choice, and using Material apps provides a scaffold widget that's already has a default banner, background color, and has API for adding drawers, snack bars, and bottom sheets. Then we can add the Center widget directly to the body property for the home page as an example and instead of using no material apps we need to define our customization and implementation and by default a non-Material app doesnâ€™t include an AppBar, title, or background color. If we want these features in a non-Material app, we have to build them ourself.
